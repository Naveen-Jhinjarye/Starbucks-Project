ðŸš€ Project: Starbucks Coffee Shop Analysis Dashboard & Presentation

Iâ€™m excited to share a recent project where I analyzed Starbucks coffee shop sales data. Over 26 weeks, I created a detailed Power BI dashboard that highlights key business insights and trends, including:

Revenue Trends: Sharp decline in Week 26, with a 21.37% drop compared to Week 25.
Product Insights: Coffee (â‚¹23M) remains the top seller, with opportunities for cross-selling tea and bakery items.
Location Performance: Paschim Vihar and IGI Airport outperformed Connaught Circle.
Operational Focus: A detailed action plan for improving sales during off-peak hours.
This project helped me improve my data analysis skills using Power BI, and Iâ€™m looking forward in my pdf files in github account to more such insights!
